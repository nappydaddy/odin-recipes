    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Slice of bread (Publix White Mountain Bread works best; you'll see why)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove crust from slice of bread. Set aside for later use.</li>
        <li>Tear inner bread into several even pieces.</li>
        <li>Take each piece and smush it between your fingers until it forms a perfect cube.</li>
        <li>While taking a break from all the smushing, use the flour-dusted crust to give yourself a cocaine-stach. Now you're looking great.</li>
        <li>Finish smushing all remaining bread pieces.</li>
        <li>Enjoy while looking like a drug addict! The cubes can be eaten whole or in small bites! Delish!</li>
    </ol>
