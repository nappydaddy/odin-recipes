# odin-recipes
This is where I will apply all of  the knowledge I have gained thus far in creating a website and tracking changes in git. Not only will this result in a working webpage, but will also be a great document for keeping all of my wonderful recipes!

I hope you enjoy as you explore the tasts of my childhood.
